# Onyx Data November 2024 Challenge

## Title: Supply Chain Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis reveals a transparent view of the dataset showcasing supply chain performance from production to distribution. This will aid stakeholders in optimizing supply processes and making more informed decisions.
I have curated two well-detailed and interactive dashboards that provide insights into products, supplier performance, logistics, and inventory trends. 

## Data Source:
Onyx Data provided this dataset via their LinkedIn profile. It contained 26 columns and 100 rows.

Power BI: Visualization.

## Data Processing:
I deployed Power BI DAX's functionality to track total KPI metrics amongst essential data fields such as product type and Shipping carriers.

## Data Analysis:
Overview: I have identified key revenue drivers, including product performance, customer demographics, SKU performance, to gain a clear understanding of inventory trends and availability.

Supplier and Logistics: This analysis uncovered supplier performance, shipping analysis and transportation modes.

## Recommendations:
By implementing the following recommended actions, the company can optimize its supply chain, improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth:

- Products with more sales should always be in stock to boost revenue.  

- Locations with lower sales and revenue may require localized marketing or distribution strategies.
  
- Explore alternative suppliers to reduce reliance on Supplier 1.
  
- Prioritize timely deliveries to improve customer satisfaction.
  
- Optimize delivery routes to minimize transportation costs and delivery time.

- Implement quality improvement initiatives like waste management to reduce defect rates.
